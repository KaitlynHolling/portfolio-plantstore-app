Mobile Development Spring 2023 Portfolio Project - Simple Plant Store E-Commerce App
For this project I chose Option 2 and created a new React Native project, 
I created a simple Plant Store E-Commerce App. The screens I created are a Home screen, Cart screen, Navigation Screen,
and multiple plant category pages. The states are adding plants to the cart, emptying the cart, adding or subtracting
number of each plant in cart, checking out, and navigating through drawer navigation or navigation page.
